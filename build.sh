# Starts NDK build in the current directory.
# Compiled executables will be placed under the `libs' directory.
#
# To properly copy built executables to the device call deploy.sh.
# 
# You need installed Android NDK r6b or higher to compile. 
# A suitable NDK can be always obtained from Google:
#    http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
#
# If you develop C++ applications using Qt and wish to deploy to Android, you
# might be interested in the Necessitas project:
#    http://necessitas.sf.net
# which, as of this writing, comes bundled with NDK r6b.
